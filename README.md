# data_cleaning_with_sql

Data cleaning is a critical step before performing any exploratory analysis on a dataset. It ensures that the data is accurate, complete, and consistent, which is essential for producing reliable insights. By cleaning the data, we also enhance its usability and accessibility for subsequent analysis and data-driven decision-making.

In this project, I focused on cleaning two datasets: the World Layoff Dataset and the Pizza Runner Dataset. The goal was to ensure consistency and integrity across both datasets. I aimed to prepare the data for exploratory data analysis (EDA) by addressing issues such as missing values, duplicates, and inaccuracies. This preparation is vital to prevent building flawed algorithms or drawing incorrect conclusions during the EDA phase.

Effective data cleaning lays the foundation for meaningful analysis, enabling the extraction of actionable insights and supporting informed decision-making processes.
